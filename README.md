## Why Breeze Code

- **Agents that show their work.** A Planner writes a plan, you approve it, and a Builder carries it out. Every file read, edit and command streams into the agents panel as it happens.
- **Bring the agent you already use.** Breeze finds Codex on your computer, or connects to a local model through Ollama, LM Studio or any OpenAI-compatible server.
- **Light and local.** Your files stay on your machine, API keys are encrypted with the OS keychain, and a local model runs without the cloud.
- **Stay in the flow.** Vibe Mode plays a short-video feed while the agents work, then tells you when your code is ready.

## Features

### Plan, approve, build

Ask in plain words. The Planner reads the project and proposes a numbered plan; approve it or ask for changes, then the Builder implements it. Agent cards show who is working and on what.

### Your agent, detected

Setup scans for installed coding agents and for Git and Node.js. Pick one, or paste an API key to use a local LLM. Change it any time from Settings.

### Checkpoints with Git

Stage, discard, commit and push from the Source Control view, with a graph of your checkpoints and branches. Files an agent is editing are marked in the explorer and tabs.

### Breeze Box

Just a prompt and a chat, no editor. Code in a reply becomes an artifact card you can copy or download in one click.

### Vibe Mode

While an agent works, the IDE fades and an Instagram or Facebook feed plays. A notification tells you when the code is ready; leaving is up to you.

### And also

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Editor** | Tabs you can reorder, go to file or line, find, and syntax checking for JavaScript and TypeScript |
| **Terminal and Run** | Integrated terminal; press F5 to run C, C++, C# and Python files with the compilers Breeze finds. C# uses the .NET SDK (10 or newer for a single `.cs` file; any version inside a `.csproj` project), and Breeze tells you how to install anything that's missing |
| **Live preview** | Open `index.html` next to your code and reload as you go |
| **Local LLM** | A token-efficient agent loop: a project map, ranged file reads and snippet edits keep requests small |
| **Accounts** | Sign in with GitHub or Google, with several accounts |
| **Discord** | Rich Presence shows what you're working on |
| **Security** | API keys are encrypted with the OS keychain |

## Getting started (FOR DEVELOPER)

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` compiles `src/renderer/breezescript.ts` and launches the app. `src/renderer/breezescript.js` is build output and isn't committed, so run `npm run build` once before opening `src/renderer/breeze.html` in a browser for a demo of the UI with a sample project and canned agent runs.

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start` | Compile and run the app |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript only |
| `npm run watch` | Compile on change |
| `npm test` | Syntax-check the main process and run the tests |
| `npm run dist` | Build the Windows installer into `dist/` |

## Configuration

Sign-in and Discord presence need client ids. Copy the example file and fill in your own:

```bash
cp breeze.config.example.json breeze.config.json
```

Or put them in a `.env` file next to `main.js`:

```
BREEZE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
BREEZE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
BREEZE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
BREEZE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=
```

Environment variables override the config file. Both `breeze.config.json` and `.env` are gitignored; never commit them.

- **GitHub:** create an OAuth App and enable *Device Flow* (no secret needed).
- **Google:** create a *Desktop app* OAuth client.
- **Discord:** create an application and use its Application ID.

> [!TIP]
> Breeze assumes a local LLM has a 4k-token context on Ollama and 8k elsewhere. If you raised your server's context size, set `llmContext` in Breeze's saved state so the agent can use the extra room.

## Building the installer

```bash
npm run dist
```

This runs `scripts/write-config.js`, which writes `breeze.config.json` from your `.env` so the packaged app has its client ids, then builds `dist/Breeze Code Setup <version>.exe` with electron-builder.

> [!WARNING]
> The installer is unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen may warn on other machines. Values bundled into an installer can be extracted by anyone who has it, so only put public client ids (and Google's desktop-app secret, which is not confidential) in `.env` when building.
